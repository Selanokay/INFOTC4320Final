Welcome to our INFOTC-4320 Final! 

The important stuff to note with these files. 

The yml, dockerfile, and requirements file are necessary to run the app.py file in docker.

The testing.py file was used primarily for us to test code outside of our main file (app.py) and holds no actual use within the program itself.

The reservations webpage reserves your seat and displays your output below the actual form submission! Also note that the seating chart does not update until you push refresh!
